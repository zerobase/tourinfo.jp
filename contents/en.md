Our main project is the **Hyper Pictogram** project which aim is to promote _accessibility_ of Tokyo. For that purpose, we will make every pictograms _machine readable_, _multilingual_ and being recognizable by _image recognition technologies_.

You will easily find descriptions of outdoor, or physical, pictograms that you cannot understand their meaning by their figure. Image recognition technologies, like Google Goggles, will do it for you with a Hyper Pictogram catalog website.

Pictograms usually represents availability or unavailability of something: smoking/non-smoking, barrier-free or not, etc. Search engines will recognize digital hyper pictgrams and let you easily find events or venues which satisfy your requirements.

Moreover, Hyper Pictogram is an easy way for m17n (multilingualization) of web contents. Every description of hyper pictograms will be translated and accessible from your digital devices, so you will feel outdoor pictograms more familiar and be less likely to get lost in translation in Tokyo.
